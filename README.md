# Crime Rate Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Crime rates are increasing in many countries, and analyzing crime data can help in predicting and reducing future incidents.  
This project uses **data mining algorithms** on the **San Francisco Crime Dataset (Kaggle)** to identify patterns and predict potential future crimes.  

The system applies **clustering** and **classification** techniques based on:
- Locations where crimes occurred  
- Time and date of incidents  
- Gangs or groups involved in crimes  

By analyzing historical crime records along with geospatial and demographic information, the project aims to support law enforcement and public safety planning.

## ⚙️ Project Requirements & Workflow
1. **Understanding the project & objectives** – Define clear goals and standards.  
2. **Data Collection** – Download dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime).  
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and normalize data.  
4. **Data Splitting** – Train/Test split if not already available.  
5. **Application of Data Mining Techniques** – Implement at least 2 algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Random Forest).  
6. **Evaluation** – Use suitable metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  
7. **Visualization** – Generate plots using Matplotlib (Histogram, Pie chart, Boxplot, Scatterplot, etc.).  
8. **Documentation** – Document steps in Jupyter Notebook.  
9. **Presentation** – Summarize project purpose and results.
